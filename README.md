# landing-page

This is a personal learning project where I create a landing page. This project will demonstrate my capability with flex box properties and layout creation. 

In order to tackle this project, I intend to work section by section from top to bottom, left to right. I will use the provided colors and font properties at first, then will make changes to reflect a mock real life business or personal landing page complete with photos, content, and theme.
